# Combo Isolate
Prototype for partially-tested board game design centering on placing pieces to push pieces in 8 directions across a wrapping 5x5 square tile board. My designer friends keep telling me the game should be an app, and the current form doesn't seem fit for monitization. Intended as personal portfolio project if it goes well.
